# eccerobo spine

## eccerobo
This application is part of eccerobo project- one-man effort to create a scrap-yard robot, inspired by crayon sketch of a very hairy monkey in an ill-fitting tunic.

## spine
*spine* is a glue layer connecting all parts of the robot together. It uses libmodbus to talk with some of the actuators (i.e. motors), and pure device drivers to talk with some other devices like ultrasonic range sensor.
